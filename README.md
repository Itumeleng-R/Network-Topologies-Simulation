# Network-Topologies-Simulation
Cisco Packet Tracer project – Network Topologies, Hybrid Design, VLAN, Subnetting, and Configurations
# Network Topologies Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and configuration of different network topologies using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It covers IPv4/IPv6 configuration, VLAN segmentation, server setup, subnetting, and a hybrid topology with enhanced features.

## 🖧 Implemented Topologies
1. Bus Topology
2. Star Topology
3. Ring Topology
4. Mesh Topology
5. Extended Star Topology
6. Hybrid Topology (with VLAN, IPv4, IPv6, HTTP/DNS/DHCP servers, security)
