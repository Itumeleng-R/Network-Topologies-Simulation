## 🧭 Folder Purpose

The screenshots provide **evidence of successful implementation** of:
- IPv4 and IPv6 network configurations  
- VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing  
- Subnetting and addressing verification  
- Server and security setup  
- Full hybrid topology simulation

## ⚙️ Usage Guide

1. Use the screenshots to reference your topology layout during configuration.  
2. Include these images when writing your report or presenting your project.  
3. Each image name matches its respective `.pkt` simulation file or `.docx` report in the `/docs` folder.
