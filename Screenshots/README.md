## ðŸ“¸ Network Topology Screenshots

This repository contains configuration and topology screenshots for my **Hybrid Network Configuration Project** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The design integrates **Ring, Star, Mesh, Bus, and Extended Star** topologies under a unified hybrid system supporting both **IPv4 and IPv6 (2001:DB8:3C4D::/64)**.

### ðŸ”§ VLAN Segmentation
| VLAN | Department | Topology | Description |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 10 | Faculty | Ring | Academic network segment |
| 20 | Students | Star | Student access network |
| 30 | Guest | Mesh | Isolated guest access |
| 50 | Staff | Bus | Administrative staff LAN |
| 99 | Management & Native | Extended Star | Core management and native VLAN |

Each screenshot illustrates network design, VLAN setup, DHCP and security configurations, and device connectivity.
