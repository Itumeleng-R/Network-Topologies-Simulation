## 🗂️ Folder Contents

| 📄 File Name | 📝 Description |
|--------------|----------------|
| 🧩 **Part_I_Hybrid_Topology_Report.docx** | Comprehensive report on the Hybrid Network integrating Bus, Mesh, Star, Ring, and Extended Star topologies. Configured with VLANs, dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6), DHCP, and security. |
| 🧮 **Part_II_IP_Subnetting_Report.docx** | Detailed IP addressing and subnetting plan for each VLAN and subnet across the hybrid topology. |
| 🚌 **Bus_Topology_Report.docx** | VLAN 50 (Staff) – Structured bus layout with static switch interlinks and IPv4/IPv6 addressing. |
| ⭐ **Star_Topology_Report.docx** | VLAN 20 (Students) – Centralized management using a single switch for easy scalability. |
| 🔄 **Ring_Topology_Report.docx** | VLAN 10 (Faculty) – Fault-tolerant design with redundant paths between switches. |
| 🔗 **Mesh_Topology_Report.docx** | VLAN 30 (Guest) – Fully connected topology ensuring reliable communication. |
| 🌟 **Extended_Star_Topology_Report.docx** | VLAN 99 (Management & Native) – High-availability network with segmented control and administrative access. |
